 Despite the complexity of the physical mechanisms behind precipitation, many studies linking precipitation to weather types or atmospheric circulation focus on a single variable, oversimplifying the interactions involved. 
 A more robust alternative is the new global gridded weather typing classification (GWTC-2). 
 The GWTC-2 is a synoptic weather typing classification scheme that captures the holistic, multivariate nature of weather at any given time and location, utilizing multiple atmospheric variables.
 This study examined the association between precipitation and GWTC-2 air masses (AMs) on regional to global scales—the first use of a multivariate weather index to study precipitation. 
 Although regional differences exist, GWTC-2 AMs modulate precipitation over land than in oceanic areas. 
 There was also a noticeably weaker association between GWTC-2 AMs and tropical precipitation compared to extratropical precipitation, where up to 60% of summer precipitation variability is explained. 
 Also, land precipitation is better modulated by GWTC-2 AMs than oceanic precipitation. 
 Regarding individual GWTC-2 influences, Humid Warm AMs account for the majority of polar precipitation. 
 However, it surprisingly poorly correlates with land precipitation, likely because water vapor does not increase linearly with higher temperatures over land—as specified by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.
 Also, Humid Cool AMs contribute more than 5 times to the little precipitation in deserts compared to other humid types. 
 More interestingly, the frontal AMs, defined to capture extratropical migrating cyclones, strongly contribute to tropical precipitation and capture the West African Monsoon and local branch of the Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) remarkably well. 
 The association between GWTC-2 AMs and precipitation has potential applicability in ensemble precipitation forecasting and downscaling GCM model simulations of daily precipitation—especially in midlatitude land areas and West Africa.
